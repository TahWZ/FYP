# Final Year Project
Fault prediction software made using Python, involving various preprocessing techniques and machine learning models. The main objective was to create a software fault prediction model that is efficient in terms of performance and has the ability to solve the issue of data imbalance. A research article was made based on the project and can be found in the section below.
